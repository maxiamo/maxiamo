- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maxiamo, glad you visited this page. 

My name is Maxim, I learn pretty mush different things, like HTML, CSS, JS, Pyton for web, C# for Unity, and C++ for ..learning(?), anyway,
I like to know something new, who doesn't?

Currently I am developing a game on Unity Engine, and I hope I'll release it soon (for Android, (maybe pc version would come to))
